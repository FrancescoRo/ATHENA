Tutorials
^^^^^^^^^^

We made some tutorial examples:

- `Tutorial 1 <tutorial1intro.html>`_ shows how active subspaces studies are performed.
- `Turorial 2 <tutorial2gradients.html>`_ shows how to compute the gradients from an input-output dataset.
- `Turorial 3 <tutorial3response.html>`_ shows how to design response surfaces with active subspaces and Gaussian process regression.
- `Turorial 4 <tutorial4inverse.html>`_ shows how to employ the active subspaces property to sample from surrogate posteriors.
- `Turorial 5 <tutorial5spde.html>`_ shows how to employ the active subspaces property to vectorial outputs.
